I
ca
n't
,
Annie
.
Why
ca
n't
you
?
A
woman
could
n't
rightly
understand
my
reason
.
Because
it
's
a
stubborn
reason
.
Oh
,
I
heard
you
talking
with
the
second
mate
.
You
're
afraid
the
other
captains
will
sneer
at
you
because
you
did
n't
come
back
with
a
full
ship
.
You
want
to
live
up
to
your
silly
reputation
even
if
you
do
have
to
beat
and
starve
men
and
drive
me
mad
to
do
it
.
It
ai
n't
that
,
Annie
.
Them
skippers
would
never
dare
sneer
to
my
face
.
It
ai
n't
so
much
what
any
one
'd
say--but--you
see--I
've
always
done
it--since
my
first
voyage
as
skipper
.
I
always
come
back--with
a
full
ship--and--it
do
n't
seem
right
not
to--somehow
.
I
been
always
first
whalin
'
skipper
out
o
'
Homeport
,
and--do
n't
you
see
my
meanin
'
,
Annie
?
Annie
!
Best
turn
in
,
Annie
,
there
's
a
good
woman
.
You
ai
n't
well
.
David
!
Wo
n't
you
please
turn
back
?
I
ca
n't
,
Annie--not
yet
awhile
.
You
do
n't
see
my
meanin
'
.
I
got
to
git
the
ile
.
It
'd
be
different
if
you
needed
the
money
,
but
you
do
n't
.
You
've
got
more
than
plenty
.
It
ai
n't
the
money
I
'm
thinkin
'
of
.
D'you
think
I
'm
as
mean
as
that
?
No--I
do
n't
know--I
ca
n't
understand
.
Oh
,
I
want
to
be
home
in
the
old
house
once
more
,
and
see
my
own
kitchen
again
,
and
hear
a
woman
's
voice
talking
to
me
and
be
able
to
talk
to
her
.
Two
years
!
It
seems
so
long
ago--as
if
I
'd
been
dead
and
could
never
go
back
.
Best
go
to
bed
,
Annie
.
You
ai
n't
well
.
I
used
to
be
lonely
when
you
were
away
.
I
used
to
think
Homeport
was
a
stupid
,
monotonous
place
.
Then
I
used
to
go
down
on
the
beach
,
especially
when
it
was
windy
and
the
breakers
were
rolling
in
,
and
I
'd
dream
of
the
fine
,
free
life
you
must
be
leading
.
I
used
to
love
the
sea
then
.
But
now--I
do
n't
ever
want
to
see
the
sea
again
.
'
Tis
no
fit
place
for
a
woman
,
that
's
sure
.
I
was
a
fool
to
bring
ye
.
How
long
would
it
take
us
to
reach
home--if
we
started
now
?
'
Bout
two
months
,
I
reckon
,
Annie
,
with
fair
luck
.
That
would
be
August
,
the
latter
part
of
August
,
would
n't
it
?
It
was
on
the
twenty-fifth
of
August
we
were
married
,
David
,
was
n't
it
?
Do
n't
you
remember
?
My
memory
is
leaving
me--up
here
in
the
ice
.
It
was
so
long
ago
.
It
's
June
now
.
The
lilacs
will
be
all
in
bloom
in
the
front
yard--and
the
climbing
roses
on
the
trellis
to
the
side
of
the
house--they
're
budding
--
Go
in
and
rest
,
Annie
.
You
're
all
worn
out
cryin
'
over
what
ca
n't
be
helped
.
You
love
me
,
do
n't
you
,
David
?
Love
you
?
Why
d'you
ask
me
such
a
question
,
Annie
?
But
you
do
,
do
n't
you
,
David
?
Tell
me
!
I
'm
your
husband
,
Annie
,
and
you
're
my
wife
.
Could
there
be
aught
but
love
between
us
after
all
these
years
?
Then
you
do
love
me
.
Say
it
!
I
do
,
Annie
.
I
sometimes
think
if
we
could
only
have
had
a
child--And
I
've
always
been
a
good
wife
to
you
,
have
n't
I
,
David
?
No
man
has
ever
had
a
better
,
Annie
.
And
I
've
never
asked
for
much
from
you
,
have
I
,
David
?
Have
I
?
You
know
you
could
have
all
I
got
the
power
to
give
ye
,
Annie
.
Then
do
this
,
this
once
,
for
my
sake
,
for
God
's
sake--take
me
home
!
It
's
killing
me
,
this
life--the
brutality
and
cold
and
horror
of
it
.
I
'm
going
mad
.
I
can
feel
the
threat
in
the
air
.
I
ca
n't
bear
the
silence
threatening
me--day
after
gray
day
and
every
day
the
same
.
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
I
'll
go
mad
,
I
know
I
will
.
Take
me
home
,
David
,
if
you
love
me
as
you
say
.
I
'm
afraid
.
For
the
love
of
God
,
take
me
home
!
